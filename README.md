Vanir is the scrappy Intel NUC hero of the homelab — small but shockingly capable.  
It runs on an i5-5300U, 16GB of RAM, and enough determination to power a small village.

### 🧭 Purpose
Vanir handles lightweight LXCs, development tools, streaming utilities, and auxiliary services.  
Think of it as the utility knife of the environment: not the strongest, but always handy.

### 🏗️ Current Highlights
- All-LXC setup for minimal overhead
- Streamer LXC using FFMPEG to broadcast Grafana dashboards to Twitch (for science… or bragging)
- Pathfinder 2e wiki/tools container for instant rule lookups
- Proxmox Datacenter Manager for keeping the larger cluster honest
